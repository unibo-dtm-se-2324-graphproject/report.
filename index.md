## Abstract

This project, **GraphProject**, aims to develop a tutor recommendation system that allows users to find the best tutors based on preferences such as age, mode of teaching (remote or in-person), and location. The system features a graph plotting tool where users can input equations and specify X and Y ranges for visualization. It includes an API for scalable tutor recommendations and a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the design, development, and testing processes involved in the project.
