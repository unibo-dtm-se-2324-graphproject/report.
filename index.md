## Abstract

GraphProject is an intuitive and user-friendly system designed to generate and visualize mathematical graphs. It empowers users—particularly students and educators—to input mathematical equations and specify range values, facilitating effective visualization of data. By transforming complex mathematical expressions into clear graphical representations, GraphProject serves as an essential educational tool that enhances understanding and engagement with mathematical concepts.

The core features of GraphProject include an easy-to-use interface where users can enter various equations, such as \(y = x^2\), and adjust the X and Y ranges to generate accurate graphs. This interactivity allows users to experiment with different equations and observe immediate visual results, making the learning process dynamic and engaging. 

GraphProject’s architecture comprises a frontend component that provides a seamless user experience for inputting equations and viewing graphs, along with a backend system that handles requests related to graph generation. 

In addition, the project incorporates a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing, building, and deployment processes, enhancing the overall efficiency of development. 

By focusing on accessibility and usability, GraphProject aims to foster a greater appreciation for mathematics and its applications in various fields. Ultimately, this project stands as a testament to the importance of intuitive design in educational tools, providing users with the resources necessary to explore and visualize mathematical concepts confidently.

## Disclaimer about the project:
During the preparation of this work, I used CHATgpt to write codes because I have a management background. After using this tool/service, I reviewed and edited the content as needed and I take full responsibility for the content of the final report/artifact. However, I put a lot of effort into learning and starting from the basics by looking at class materials and resources provided online, it was a difficult journey but I believe that was a great opportunity to learn, especially because it was totally an indivudal project.
