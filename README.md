# GraphProject

## Description

GraphProject is an intuitive system designed for generating and visualizing mathematical graphs. Users can input equations and specify range values to visualize their data effectively. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for students, educators, and anyone interested in graphing mathematical concepts.

## Features

- **Equation Input**: Users can enter mathematical equations (e.g., y = x^2).
- **Graph Visualization**: Specify X and Y ranges to generate accurate graphs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction.
- **API Integration**: Scalable API for efficient graph rendering.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface for inputting equations and displaying graphs.
- **Backend API**: Handles requests for graph generation and supports scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
