## Validation

## Testing

- The project utilized Jest for testing the functionality of the application, focusing on the server's ability to handle requests.

- The success rate for the implemented tests is 100%, as all tests have passed without any failures.

- The coverage report indicates that the application has a statement coverage of 81.81%, branch coverage of 75%, and function coverage of 50%. These metrics suggest that while a significant portion of the code is tested, there are areas that could benefit from additional tests to improve coverage.

**Test Development Process**:
The development of tests followed the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). Each new feature or functionality was accompanied by the creation of corresponding unit tests before implementation. This ensured that the code was written to pass tests, thus maintaining high code quality from the outset.

## Acceptance test

- The acceptance test focused on the GET request to the root endpoint ('/'), ensuring it responds with a status code of 200.

- The outcome was successful, confirming that the application meets the basic requirement for handling requests effectively.
