# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- **Representation**: The user after entering an equation can visualize the graph by simply clicking on the plot graph. 
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The corresponding graph should be generated within a few seconds of submission.
- **Multiple Graphing Capability**: Users can enter multiple equations and visualize multiple graphs simultaneously for comparative analysis.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The graphs displayed are in different colors to allow better comparison.
- **Static Graph Updates**: Users to enter a new equation and visualize different graphs s/he should refresh the browser page. 
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Changes made to the input fields should require a submit action to generate and display the updated graphs.
- **User Interface**: The application must provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both graph input and visualization.
    - **Acceptance Criteria** :  Users should find the interface straightforward.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **Requirement**: The application must handle concurrent users and maintain responsiveness during peak usage.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The system should respond to user actions within **2 seconds** under normal load and within **5 seconds** under high load.
  
### 2. Reliability
- **Requirement**: The application should be stable, with minimal downtime.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System availability should be high.
  - Errors must be logged, and crashes must not interrupt core functionalities.
    
### 3. Scalability
- **Requirement**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future user growth.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The architecture should support scaling.
  - Backend components (e.g., graph rendering logic) should be modular and distributable.

### 4. Maintainability
- **Requirement**: Code should be easy to maintain and extend.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Code should follow standard style guides (linted).
  - Tests must cover core functions (e.g., API responses, graph output).
  - Use of CI/CD to ensure safe and automated deployments.


## Implementation Requirements

- **Backend Development**: The backend should be developed using Node.js and Express to handle graph generation requests and manage user inputs effectively.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The API should be designed to process user inputs for equations and range specifications, returning the necessary data to generate the graphs.
- **Frontend Development**: Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive web application that interacts with the backend.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The frontend should allow users to input equations and visualize graphs easily.
- **Graphing Library**: Implement a graphing library to render graphs based on user inputs.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The library should effectively display mathematical functions and allow customization of graph properties (e.g., color, scale). 
- **Publishing**: The Graph Website package should be published on npm to allow users to install and utilize the tool easily.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The package should include clear documentation on installation and usage, making it easy for developers and users to integrate the tool into their projects.


## User Stories

**For Students and Learners**

As a high school student, I want to plot mathematical graphs by entering equations so that I can better understand algebra and functions visually.
As a university student, I want to compare two graphs side by side so that I can analyze their intersections and behavior differences.
As a non-technical learner, I want a simple and intuitive interface so that I donâ€™t need prior coding knowledge to use the tool.

**For Educators**

As a teacher, I want to create and share graph visualizations in class so that I can explain math concepts more interactively.
As an instructor, I want to show how graphs change in real-time when modifying an equation so that I can demonstrate cause-effect relationships clearly.
